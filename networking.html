    <h1>Networking Concepts Used</h1>

    <h2>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
    <p>
        This is a system used in IP networks. Simply put, it refers to the use of easy-to-remember domain names, as IP addresses, which are a series of numbers, are difficult to memorize. It facilitates internet use by converting domain names into IP addresses that can be accessed on IP networks.
    </p>

    <h2>IP Addressing</h2>
    <p>
        IP addressing identifies network interfaces, provides a host's location within a network, and is used to establish routing. <strong>IPv4</strong> uses a 32-bit address space, while <strong>IPv6</strong> uses a 128-bit address space. This website is accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    </p>

    <h2>Protocols</h2>
    <p>
        The website uses <strong>HTTPS over TCP/IP</strong>. TCP/IP is the underlying protocol of the Internet, enabling various data communications. It allows us to use various Internet functions, such as visiting websites and sending emails. HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the server is encrypted and secure.
