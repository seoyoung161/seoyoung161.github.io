    <h1>How Networking Makes My Website Work</h1>

    <h2>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
    <p>
        This is a system used in IP networks. Simply put, it refers to the use of easy-to-remember domain names, as IP addresses, which are a series of numbers, are difficult to memorize. It facilitates internet use by converting domain names into IP addresses that can be accessed on IP networks. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>My domain <strong>seoyoung161.github.io</strong> is resolved to an IP address so that users can access the server without memorizing numbers. Through the <code>nslookup</code> command, I confirmed my domain points to GitHub's server IPs.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
        Resolved IP (IPv6): 2606:50c0:8000::153<br>
        Resolved IP (IPv4): 185.199.108.153
    </div>
  
    <h2>IP Addressing</h2>
    <p>
        IP addressing identifies network interfaces, provides a host's location within a network, and is used to establish routing. <strong>IPv4</strong> uses a 32-bit address space, while <strong>IPv6</strong> uses a 128-bit address space. This website is accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>This website uses both <strong>IPv4 and IPv6</strong> addresses. When I ping my domain, it responds via IPv6 (2606:50c0:8000::153), which is a 128-bit address space, ensuring modern connectivity.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Protocols & Status Codes</h2>
    <p>
        The website uses <strong>HTTPS over TCP/IP</strong>. TCP/IP is the underlying protocol of the Internet, enabling various data communications. It allows us to use various Internet functions, such as visiting websites and sending emails. HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the server is encrypted and secure. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>This site enforces <strong>HTTPS</strong> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt data. Using Browser Developer Tools, I verified the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Status Code:</strong> 200 OK :  It means the request was successful.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (over TLS)</li>
        <li><strong>Server Address:</strong> [2606:50c0:8000::153]:443</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see my 200 OK status and response headers in the Network tab of your browser's inspect tool.</p>
